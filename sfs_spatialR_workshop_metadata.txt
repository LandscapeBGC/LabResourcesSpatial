Details for Fundamentals of Spatial Data Access and Analysis in R taught at SFS 2018 by Marcus Beck and Ryan Hill. 
"The setup instructions are available on our website.  Just click the “Before SFS” tab at the top and follow the instruction on each page:  https://ryan-hill.github.io/sfs-r-gis-2018/. In particular, please pay attention to the version of R you will install or have installed on your machine. Many of the GIS packages currently require R version 3.4.4. Second, please take the time to review and install the appropriate R packages once you ensure that you are using R 3.4.4."
Their website is great, my markdowns generally walk through the syllabus they have laid out, but has additional notes. 
Order of the Rmarkdowns should be:
workshop 
VectorEx
Vector Ex2
SimpleFeatures
raster1
mapping1
mapping2
